This project brief serves as the foundational document that guides all development decisions, architectural choices, and business priorities for Hotel Operations Hub.

## New Modules (v1): Concierge + Vendors

- Concierge: Orchestrate guest experiences end-to-end via configurable Concierge Objects (EAV attributes), Playbooks (SLA/dependency automation via workers), and ops-first views (Reservation 360, Guest Timeline, Today Board).
- Vendors: Partner directory, policies, vendor links and confirmations, multi-channel notifications, and a magic-link portal (scoped PII).
- Multi-tenant: All data tenant-scoped by `organizationId` and `propertyId`. File storage via R2 with tenant paths `/org-id/property-id/...`.

### Module Enablement & Billing Direction
- Extend `ModuleSubscription` to support `propertyId` (optional) to enable:
  - Org-level enablement (single subscription record with `propertyId = NULL`).
  - Property-level overrides (additional records per property).
- Precedence: property-level overrides org-level for effective enablement.
- Future billing: org pays for all, property pays for itself, or hybridâ€”enabled by property-scoped subscriptions.

### Decisions
- Attributes: EAV pattern for Concierge object fields (typed columns + indexes).
- Playbooks/SLAs: worker-driven processors and timers.
- Vendor Portal: magic-link token (hashed, expiry), scoped PII rendering.
