**Priority**: System stability achieved, ready for next development phase

## ‚úÖ LATEST MAJOR SUCCESS - Permission System Optimization Complete - August 27, 2025
**Achievement**: Critical permission system enhancements resolving all access control and hotel operations integration issues

### PERMISSION SYSTEM OPTIMIZATION - COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY ‚úÖ
Complete permission system optimization and hotel operations integration:
1. ‚úÖ **PLATFORM_ADMIN Unrestricted Access** - Fixed tenant filtering for global platform administration
2. ‚úÖ **Permission Service Enhancement** - Resolved TypeScript errors and source field mapping
3. ‚úÖ **Hotel Operations Permissions** - Added comprehensive permission set to eliminate 403 errors
4. ‚úÖ **System Role API Enhancement** - All system roles now properly exposed in management endpoints

6. ‚úÖ **Frontend Stability** - Created bulletproof components preventing filter and rendering errors
7. ‚úÖ **Production Readiness** - All critical permission system issues resolved for hotel operations

### ‚úÖ PREVIOUS MAJOR SUCCESS - Frontend Modernization - August 27, 2025
- **Achievement**: Updated all frontend dependencies, migrated to ESLint v9, removed debug logging, and optimized the application for production builds.
- **Key Changes**: React 18.3.1, Vite 5.4, TypeScript 5.6, TanStack Query 5.62.
- **Improvements**: Enhanced build configuration with chunk splitting, disabled sourcemaps in production, and introduced a production-safe logger utility.

### Historical Implementation Summaries

-   **Tenant Security (August 2025)**: A global tenant context middleware system was implemented, including a `TenantInterceptor`, `TenantContextService`, and `TenantQueryHelper`. This provided multi-layer protection (JWT, Interceptor, Guard, Query, Result) and established automatic, role-based tenant filtering for all database queries, eliminating critical cross-tenant data leakage vulnerabilities.
-   **R2 Storage Migration (August 2025)**: Implemented Cloudflare R2 storage integration, including an `R2Service`, an enhanced `StorageService` with hybrid-mode capabilities, a `StorageMigrationService` for batch processing, and admin APIs/CLI tools for managing the migration from Railway's local filesystem. This established a scalable, tenant-scoped file storage architecture.
-   **Phase 2 UX Improvements (August 2025)**: Completed enhancements for list operations, including an `EnhancedTable` component with advanced pagination, a bulk operations framework (`useBulkSelection`), extended export functionality (`useExport`), and inline editing capabilities (`useInlineEdit`), significantly improving workflow efficiency.
-   **Phase 1 UX Improvements (August 2025)**: Established the foundational UX patterns for the modernized frontend. This included real-time form validation with Zod and `react-hook-form`, a centralized `toastService` for user feedback, skeleton loaders for improved perceived performance, and context-aware breadcrumb navigation.
-   **Permission System Fix (August 2025)**: Resolved a critical bug where permission tables were not detected in production. The fix involved a robust PostgreSQL `information_schema` check, retry logic, environment variable overrides (`FORCE_PERMISSION_SYSTEM`), and new admin debugging endpoints for system status and re-initialization.
-   **Logging Modernization (August 2025)**: Addressed a critical logging crisis that was hitting Railway's rate limits. The solution involved implementing environment-aware logging (`LOG_LEVEL=warn` in production), removing `console.log` spam (especially from `TenantInterceptor`), and updating backend dependencies like NestJS and Prisma.
-   **User Role Management Integration (August 2025)**: A comprehensive UI and hook-based system (`useUserRoleManagement`) was created to manage role assignments within user profiles. This included components for role selection, viewing assignment history, and previewing effective permissions, all integrated with the multi-tenant context.
-   **Hotel Core Operations Backend (August 2025)**: The backend modules for core hotel operations (Units, Guests, Reservations) were implemented. This included creating the necessary controllers, services, DTOs, and integrating them with the multi-tenant security model, permission system, and audit logging.
-   **Modular Role System (Phase 1)**: Extended the permission system to support external user types (CLIENT, VENDOR) and dynamic module enablement. This laid the groundwork for a modular UI where features could be restricted based on the user's role and organization's subscriptions.

## ‚úÖ PREVIOUS MAJOR SUCCESS - White-Label Branding System FULLY OPERATIONAL - August 26, 2025
**Achievement**: Complete white-label branding system with Brand Studio interface, real-time theme switching, and comprehensive UI integration

### CONTROLLER HOTFIX - August 26, 2025
- **Issue**: `/api/profile/photos` was returning "User not found".
- **Root Cause**: The `@RequirePermission('user.read.own')` decorator was interfering with user resolution in the `PermissionGuard`.
- **Solution**: Replaced the decorator with `@Roles(...)` to align with a similar, working endpoint, resolving the user context issue. This was a temporary hotfix, with a long-term plan to investigate the `PermissionGuard` interaction.

## New Focus: Concierge + Vendors Modules (Initiated)
**Date**: August 27, 2025  
**Scope**: Implement Concierge (EAV objects, playbooks/SLAs, ops views) and Vendors (directory, policies, confirmations, magic-link portal)

### Key Decisions (Approved)
- Attributes: **EAV model** for Concierge object fields
- Automation: **Worker-driven playbooks & SLAs** (background jobs)
- Vendor Portal: **Magic-link** session with scoped PII
- Enablement: Extend **ModuleSubscription** with optional `propertyId`; property overrides org-level

### Immediate Next Steps
1. Prisma migrations: `ConciergeObject`, `ConciergeAttribute`, `ObjectType`, `Playbook`, `Vendor`, `VendorLink`; extend `ModuleSubscription.propertyId`
2. API controllers: Concierge `object-types`, `objects`, `playbooks/execute`; Vendors `links/confirm`, `portal/:token`
3. Workers: SLA enforcement loop, playbook executor, vendor notifications
4. Frontend: Module manifests; Today Board, Reservation 360 checklist, Guest Timeline; Vendor portal view
5. Permissions: New permission keys and role mappings (concierge.*, vendors.*)
6. Testing: Railway deploy; Playwright E2E (desktop + mobile), screenshots, console clean

### Risks & Mitigations
- EAV query complexity ‚Üí Composite indexes and query helpers
- Portal security ‚Üí Short-lived tokens, minimal PII projection, audit logs
- Enablement caching ‚Üí API cache with invalidation on subscription change
- SLA timers drift ‚Üí Idempotent jobs with clock skew tolerance
