## Example UX Improvement

### Improvement ID: UX-20241221-001

**Title**: Add Contextual Property Management to Organization Details Modal  
**Module**: Organizations  
**Component**: OrganizationDetailsModal → Properties Tab  
**Priority**: High

### Current Behavior
When viewing an organization's details, the Properties tab displays a read-only list of properties. Users who want to add, edit, or manage properties must:
1. Close the organization modal
2. Navigate to the Properties page
3. Remember which organization they were working with
4. Perform property management tasks
5. Navigate back to verify changes

**Total**: 8+ clicks and context switching

### Proposed Improvement
Add contextual action buttons directly in the Properties tab:
- "Add Property" button at the top of the tab
- "Edit" and "Delete" buttons for each property row
- Inline property creation/editing within the modal
- Immediate reflection of changes in the organization view

**Reduced to**: 2-3 clicks, no context switching

### User Impact
- **Time Savings**: 30-60 seconds per property management task
- **Reduced Errors**: No need to remember organization context
- **Better Discovery**: Property management more intuitive
- **Improved Satisfaction**: Workflow feels integrated and efficient

### Implementation Suggestion
```
Properties Tab Layout:
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Properties (3)              [+ Add] │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Property Name    Type    [Edit][Del]│
│ Grand Hotel      Hotel   [Edit][Del]│
│ Beach Resort     Resort  [Edit][Del]│
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Priority Justification
- **High Impact**: Affects all users managing properties
- **Low Effort**: Can reuse existing property forms
- **Frequent Use**: Property management is a core workflow
- **User Expectation**: Users naturally expect actions where they view data

This improvement addresses the exact type of UX friction this testing is designed to identify and prioritize.
