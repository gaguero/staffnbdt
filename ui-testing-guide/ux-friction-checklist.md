### Feedback and Confirmation Issues (LOW PRIORITY)

#### Missing Success/Error Messages
- [ ] **Action Confirmations**
  - Some operations complete without clear success indication
  - Error messages not always specific enough
  - No undo options for destructive actions

- [ ] **Loading States**
  - Some operations don't show progress indicators
  - Long-running tasks lack progress feedback
  - No estimation of completion times

#### Validation Problems
- [ ] **Form Validation Timing**
  - Validation only on submit, not real-time
  - Error messages not positioned near relevant fields
  - No input format guidance

### Mobile and Responsive Issues (LOW PRIORITY)

#### Mobile Navigation
- [ ] **Touch-Friendly Controls**
  - Buttons may be too small for mobile
  - No swipe gestures for common actions
  - Tables difficult to navigate on mobile

- [ ] **Responsive Layout**
  - Some modals may not fit mobile screens properly
  - Form layouts may not optimize for mobile
  - Navigation menu behavior on mobile

## Severity Classification

### Critical (Must Fix)
- Blocks core functionality
- Prevents task completion
- Causes data loss or corruption
- Security vulnerabilities

### Major (Should Fix)
- Significantly impacts workflow efficiency
- Causes user frustration or confusion
- Inconsistent with user expectations
- Missing expected functionality

### Minor (Nice to Have)
- Small workflow improvements
- Visual inconsistencies
- Performance optimizations
- Convenience features

## Testing Instructions

### For Each Module, Check:
1. **View Data → Take Action Pattern**
   - When viewing lists or details, are relevant actions available?
   - Can users act on data without leaving context?

2. **Common Task Efficiency**
   - Count clicks required for frequent operations
   - Identify unnecessary page loads or context switches

3. **Information Scent**
   - Are there clear indicators of what actions are possible?
   - Do users know what will happen before clicking?

4. **Error Recovery**
   - Can users easily recover from mistakes?
   - Are error messages helpful and actionable?

### Documentation Format

For each UX issue identified:
```
**Issue**: Brief description
**Location**: Specific page/component (e.g., OrganizationDetailsModal → Properties tab)
**Current Behavior**: What happens now
**Expected Behavior**: What should happen instead
**Impact**: How this affects user workflow
**Suggested Solution**: Specific improvement recommendation
**Priority**: Critical/Major/Minor
```

### Common UX Patterns to Look For

#### Good UX Indicators
- Actions available where users expect them
- Minimal clicks for common tasks
- Clear feedback for all user actions
- Consistent behavior across similar contexts
- Helpful error messages and recovery options

#### Red Flags
- "View-only" modals that should allow actions
- Forced navigation for simple operations
- Statistics or summaries that aren't interactive
- Missing bulk operations for repetitive tasks
- Inconsistent button placement or behavior
