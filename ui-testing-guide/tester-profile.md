## Key Testing Approaches

### UX Friction Detection
Look for these specific issues:
- **Missing Contextual Actions**: View modals that show data but lack action buttons
- **Workflow Interruptions**: Having to leave current context to perform related actions
- **Navigation Inefficiencies**: Excessive clicking for common tasks
- **Missing Bulk Operations**: No way to select and act on multiple items
- **Information Dead Ends**: Statistics that aren't clickable for drill-down

### Systematic Testing Method
1. **Feature Completeness**: Does everything work as implemented?
2. **UX Optimization**: Could workflows be more efficient?
3. **Edge Cases**: How does the system handle unexpected input?
4. **Cross-Module Integration**: Do related features work together smoothly?
5. **Performance**: Are interactions responsive and feedback clear?

## Testing Environment

### Application Access
- **Frontend URL**: https://frontend-production-55d3.up.railway.app

- Comprehensive UX improvement recommendations
- Performance and usability observations
- Cross-browser compatibility notes

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### Don't Focus On
- **Permission Restrictions**: Roberto has full access - this will be tested separately
- **Content Creation**: Don't spend time creating extensive test data
- **Minor Visual Issues**: Focus on functional and workflow problems
- **Browser Compatibility**: Unless issues significantly impact functionality

### Do Focus On
- **Missing Features**: Functionality that should exist but doesn't
- **Workflow Efficiency**: How to reduce user effort
- **Integration Points**: How features work together
- **User Experience**: Real-world usability improvements
- **Performance Issues**: Slow loading or unresponsive interactions
