```

### Migration Process
1. **Pre-migration**: Health checks and configuration validation
2. **Dry Run**: Preview migration scope without changes
3. **Batch Migration**: Process files in configurable batches
4. **Verification**: Integrity checks comparing source and destination
5. **Cutover**: Switch storage mode in configuration
6. **Cleanup**: Remove empty directories and temporary files

## API Endpoints

### Admin Management (Platform Admin Required)
- `POST /admin/storage/migrate/to-r2` - Start migration
- `POST /admin/storage/rollback/from-r2` - Rollback migration
- `GET /admin/storage/verify/migration` - Verify integrity
- `GET /admin/storage/config` - Get configuration status
- `GET /admin/storage/stats/tenant` - Storage statistics
- `POST /admin/storage/health/r2` - Health check

### CLI Commands
```bash
# Health check
npm run script:migrate-storage -- --health-check

# Migration
npm run script:migrate-storage -- --migrate --dry-run
npm run script:migrate-storage -- --migrate --batch-size=20

# Verification
npm run script:migrate-storage -- --verify

# Rollback
npm run script:migrate-storage -- --rollback --dry-run
```
