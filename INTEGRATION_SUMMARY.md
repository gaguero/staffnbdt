  enableRoleManagement={hasPermission('role.assign.property')}
  onRoleChange={(user, newRoles) => handleUserRoleChange(user, newRoles)}
  maxVisibleRoles={3}
  showRoleHistory={true}
/>
```

### 2. Standalone Role Management Section
```tsx
<UserRoleSection
  user={selectedUser}
  showHistory={true}
