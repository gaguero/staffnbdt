# Railway Production Deployment Guide

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for safely deploying the permission system to Railway production environment.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Option 1: Safe Initial Deployment (Recommended)
```bash
# Deploy schema only, skip permissions initially
npm run deploy:production:schema-only

# Verify deployment
npm run verify:production

# Enable permissions when ready
npm run deploy:production:permissions
```

### Option 2: Full Deployment
```bash
# Deploy everything at once
npm run deploy:production:permissions

# Verify deployment
npm run verify:production
```

### Option 3: Preview Changes (No Risk)
```bash
# See what would happen without making changes
npm run deploy:production:dry-run

# Detailed verification output
npm run verify:production:detailed
```

## üìã Pre-Deployment Checklist

### 1. Railway Environment Setup
- [ ] Railway project created and configured
- [ ] PostgreSQL service provisioned
- [ ] Environment variables configured (see below)
- [ ] Domain and SSL configured (if needed)

### 2. Database Readiness
- [ ] Database is accessible and has recent backup
- [ ] Current schema is up to date
- [ ] No pending critical migrations
- [ ] Database has sufficient storage space

### 3. Application Readiness
- [ ] Code changes tested locally
- [ ] Permission decorators ready to deploy
- [ ] Rollback plan prepared
- [ ] Team notified of deployment window

## üîß Railway Environment Variables

### Required Variables
```bash
# Database connection (auto-configured by Railway)
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...

# Application configuration
NODE_ENV=production
JWT_SECRET=your-secure-jwt-secret-here
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=7d

# Permission system configuration
SKIP_PERMISSION_INIT=true    # Set to false when ready to enable permissions
```

### Optional Variables (Advanced)
```bash
# Deployment configuration
DRY_RUN=false               # Set to true for preview mode
AUTO_ROLLBACK=true          # Automatically rollback on failure
BACKUP_ENABLED=true         # Create deployment backup

# Emergency settings
EMERGENCY_ROLLBACK=false    # Required for production rollbacks
```

### Setting Environment Variables in Railway
1. Go to your Railway dashboard
2. Select your project and service
3. Go to "Variables" tab
4. Add each variable with its value
5. Deploy the changes

## üì¶ Deployment Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Fresh Database (New Installation)
```bash
# 1. Deploy schema and setup basic structure
npm run deploy:production:schema-only

# 2. Verify everything is working
npm run verify:production

# 3. Enable permissions when ready
SKIP_PERMISSION_INIT=false npm run deploy:production:permissions
```

### Scenario 2: Existing Database (Migration)
```bash
# 1. Preview the migration
npm run deploy:production:dry-run

# 2. Deploy with auto-rollback enabled
AUTO_ROLLBACK=true npm run deploy:production:permissions

# 3. Verify successful migration
npm run verify:production:detailed
```

### Scenario 3: Emergency Rollback
```bash
# 1. Preview rollback (recommended first)
npm run rollback:production:dry-run

# 2. Execute rollback (DANGEROUS!)
CONFIRM_ROLLBACK=true EMERGENCY_ROLLBACK=true npm run rollback:production:permissions

# 3. Verify system is restored
npm run verify:production
```

## üîí Security Considerations

### Database Security
- Railway PostgreSQL is isolated by default
- Use strong passwords and rotate regularly
- Monitor connection logs for suspicious activity
- Enable Railway's audit logging if available

### Environment Variables
- Never commit secrets to code repository
- Use Railway's encrypted variable storage
- Rotate JWT secrets periodically
- Monitor for unauthorized access

### Access Control
- Limit Railway project access to essential team members
- Use Railway's team management features
- Enable two-factor authentication
- Regular access audits

## üìä Monitoring and Alerts

### Railway Platform Monitoring
```bash
# View real-time logs
railway logs

# Check service status
railway status

# Monitor resource usage
railway ps
```

### Application Health Checks
```bash
# Verify deployment health
npm run verify:production

# Check specific components
railway run npm run verify:production:detailed

# Database connectivity test
railway run npx prisma db pull --preview-feature
```

### Custom Monitoring Setup
1. **Database Monitoring**
   - Set up connection pool monitoring
   - Track query performance
   - Monitor storage usage

2. **Application Monitoring**
   - API response times
   - Error rates and patterns
   - User authentication success rates

3. **Permission System Monitoring**
   - Permission check performance
   - Failed authorization attempts
   - User role distribution

## üîÑ Rollback Procedures

### When to Rollback
- Permission system is causing authentication failures
- Database corruption or performance issues
- Critical application functionality is broken
- User access is severely impacted

### Rollback Types

#### 1. Application-Level Rollback (Recommended)
```bash
# Revert to previous code version
git revert <commit-hash>
git push origin main

# Railway will auto-deploy the revert
```

#### 2. Permission System Rollback (Nuclear Option)
```bash
# Preview what will be removed
npm run rollback:production:dry-run

# Execute rollback (REMOVES ALL PERMISSION DATA)
CONFIRM_ROLLBACK=true EMERGENCY_ROLLBACK=true npm run rollback:production:permissions
```

#### 3. Database Rollback (Emergency Only)
```bash
# Restore from Railway backup (via Railway dashboard)
# Or use database-specific restore commands
```

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Migration Fails
```bash
# Check migration status
railway run npx prisma migrate status

# Try manual migration
railway run npx prisma migrate deploy

# Fallback: Push schema directly
railway run npx prisma db push --accept-data-loss
```

#### 2. Permission Seeding Fails
```bash
# Check if permissions already exist
railway run npm run permissions:validate

# Force re-seed (removes existing)
railway run npm run permissions:seed

# Check database connectivity
railway run npx prisma db pull
```

#### 3. User Migration Fails
```bash
# Check user count and roles
railway run npm run verify:production

# Try migration again (idempotent)
railway run npm run permissions:migrate

# Rollback if necessary
railway run npm run permissions:rollback
```

#### 4. Application Won't Start
```bash
# Check Railway logs
railway logs

# Verify environment variables
railway variables

# Check database connection
railway run npm run verify:production
```
